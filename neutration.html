                        Research has indicated that users of whey protein prior to training will illicit better results
                        than
                        those using other protein sources (or none at all).

                        This is most likely due to the anti-catabolic and anabolic signaling effects of the
                        branched-chain.

                        to fuel activity.

                        Most people don't train long enough per session to need additional fuel while they train,
                        especially if they've hit their pre-workout nutrition needs. Depleted dieters, like people
                        preparing for physique competition, may benefit from extra fuel. One of the primary concerns for
                        physique athletes is muscle loss as they whittle down to mid-single-digit body-fat levels. In
                        this state, protein turnover is increased; your body actually needs more protein in a depleted
                        state than it does when you're trying to gain muscle.

                        In this scenario, branched chain amino acids are a great intra-workout supplement. The amino
                        acids provide some protection from catabolism for those folks in drastic conditions. It probably
                        wouldn't hurt a physique athlete to keep additional BCAAs flowing throughout the day. Increased
                        blood amino acid levels during training may also help elevate net protein synthesis.

                        Athletes who have unusually long training sessions or burn up extreme amounts of energy may also
                        need intra-workout fuel. This isn't the majority, mind you. Most people drinking Gatorade don't
                        actually need extra fuel for their five-minute warm-up and six-machine training routine. Extra
                        workout fuel is necessary for people who train at a high intensity for well beyond an hour.

                        An intra-workout cocktail for these individuals should include water, electrolytes, BCAAs (or
                        hydrolyzed protein), and carbohydrates. There are other possibilities, but this is a solid
                        baseline.
