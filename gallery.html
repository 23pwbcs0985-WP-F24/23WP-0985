            <p style="color: white;">When you go to the gym, 99% of the people think it's only because to change
                physical appearance.

                But Gym do's much more than that. Much much more.

                It's all start with your brain. Our body is designed subconsciously to avoid physical labour.

                But pushing your body in the gym to do so. Increases the functionality of your prefrontal cortex, part
                of the brain responsible for logical thinking.

                You are not just exercising your physical body, but your prefrontal cortex too.

            <p style="color: white;">Yes it's enough but honestly it depends on your goals. For example if a fatty guy
                wants to loose some weight we will do Cardio more than exercise, similarly When I was in first year of
                engineering i want to improve my stamina and speed so I used to go playground rather than gym. And
                nowadays my target is to maintain my physics so I exercise at home very basic exerciss like push ups,
                sit ups, pull ups, just for 30 minutes and running for 15 minutes and stretching for 15 minutes.
